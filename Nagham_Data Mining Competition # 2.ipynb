    "### Answers to Questions:\n",
    "🌈- **Why a simple linear regression model (without any activation function) is not good for classification task, compared to Perceptron/Logistic regression?**\n",
    "  - Linear regression outputs continuous values, making it unsuitable for binary classification where discrete class labels are needed. Perceptron and logistic regression models use activation functions to map the output to a binary decision boundary, making them more appropriate for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌈- **What's a decision tree and how it is different from a logistic regression model?**\n",
    "  - A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It creates a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n",
    "  - Logistic regression is a parametric linear model used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌈- **What's the difference between grid search and random search?**\n",
    "  - Grid search exhaustively searches through a specified grid of hyperparameters, evaluating all possible combinations. It is more exhaustive but may be computationally expensive.\n",
    "  - Random search randomly samples hyperparameters from specified distributions. It is less exhaustive but can be more efficient in high-dimensional parameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌈- **What's the difference between Bayesian search and random search?**\n",
    "  - Bayesian search uses probabilistic models to select the next hyperparameter values to evaluate based on past observations. It adapts and refines its search based on the results of previous evaluations.\n",
    "  - Random search, as mentioned earlier, randomly samples hyperparameters from specified distributions without considering past evaluations."

    "### The summary statistics provide valuable insights into the numerical variables in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender Distribution**: The 'gender' variable indicates a roughly balanced distribution between male (0) and female (1) participants, with a mean of approximately 0.51.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wave and Round**: These variables represent the speed dating event's wave number and round number, respectively. The mean values suggest that the dataset comprises events from various waves and rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Position and Order**: These variables relate to the position of the participant and their partner during the speed dating event. The mean position is around 9, indicating that participants were typically placed somewhere in the middle of the lineup.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Partner ID (pid)**: The 'pid' variable represents the ID of the participant's partner. The mean value is approximately 284, with a wide range of IDs observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interest Ratings**: The summary statistics also include columns such as 'attr3_3', 'sinc3_3', 'intel3_3', 'fun3_3', and 'amb3_3', which denote the interest ratings of participants in various attributes (attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition) of their partners. These ratings range from 1 to 12, with mean values indicating moderate to high interest levels across different attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Additional Ratings**: Similar interest ratings are provided for the third date ('attr5_3', 'sinc5_3', 'intel5_3', 'fun5_3', 'amb5_3'), indicating participants' perceptions of their partners after multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The correlation matrix provides insights into the linear relationship between pairs of numeric variables. Here are some observations based on the correlation coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gender and other attributes:**\n",
    "- Gender shows weak correlations (close to zero) with most other attributes. This suggests that gender may not strongly influence other variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wave and round:**\n",
    "- Wave and round have a positive correlation of approximately 0.23, indicating a moderate positive relationship. This suggests that as the wave number increases, the round number tends to increase as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attraction ratings:**\n",
    "- Attributes related to attraction show positive correlations among themselves, indicating consistency in ratings across different stages of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest ratings:**\n",
    "- Interest ratings also exhibit positive correlations with each other, suggesting that individuals tend to rate intelligence consistently across various interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun and Ambition ratings:**\n",
    "- Ratings related to fun and ambition also show positive correlations within each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partner attributes and self-ratings:**\n",
    "- Ratings provided by partners exhibit correlations with self-ratings in corresponding rounds, indicating some consistency or agreement between partners' perceptions and individuals' self-perceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order and round:**\n",
    "- The order in which participants met their partners shows a positive correlation with the round number, suggesting that the order of interactions may be related to the timing of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships between different attributes in the dataset. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis is needed to understand the underlying factors influencing these relationships.\n"

    "### Trial 4: Random Forest Classifier with Random Search\n",
    "#### Thoughts and Observations:\n",
    "- After achieving remarkable performance with the Random Forest Classifier in Trial 3, we aim to further optimize its hyperparameters using random search.\n",
    "- Random search allows us to efficiently explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations, potentially uncovering better-performing configurations compared to exhaustive grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement Random Forest Classifier with Random Search:**\n",
    "   - Define a parameter grid for RandomizedSearchCV including hyperparameters for preprocessing steps and the Random Forest classifier.\n",
    "   - Hyperparameters to be sampled include the number of trees in the forest (`n_estimators`), maximum depth of trees (`max_depth`), minimum number of samples required to split a node (`min_samples_split`), minimum number of samples required at each leaf node (`min_samples_leaf`), and others.\n",
    "   - Use RandomizedSearchCV to randomly sample a specified number of hyperparameter combinations from the parameter grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Model Performance:**\n",
    "   - After hyperparameter sampling, evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model with the sampled hyperparameters on the validation set.\n",
    "   - Calculate the ROC AUC Score to assess the performance of the Random Forest model.\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of the Random Forest model with random search to previous trials to determine improvements.\n",
    "#### Plan for Next Trial: Gradient Boosting Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diversify Model Exploration:** Up to this point, we have focused on optimizing Random Forest models. Gradient Boosting is another powerful ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones. By exploring Gradient Boosting, we aim to diversify our model exploration and potentially uncover different patterns in the data that may not be captured by Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Potential for Improved Performance:** Gradient Boosting often performs well on structured data and is known for its ability to handle complex relationships and high-dimensional feature spaces. By leveraging Gradient Boosting, we aim to improve model performance and potentially achieve higher ROC AUC scores compared to Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Robustness to Overfitting:** Gradient Boosting tends to be less prone to overfitting compared to Random Forest, especially when the number of trees (boosting iterations) is controlled properly. This can lead to more robust models that generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Importance Insights:** Gradient Boosting provides valuable insights into feature importance, which can aid in feature selection and further improve model interpretability. By analyzing feature importance, we can gain a better understanding of the factors driving successful speed dating outcomes."

    "\n",
    "- **Training the Model:**\n",

    "  - The classifier will utilize default hyperparameters during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation:**\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "- Trial 7 aimed to explore the Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost) as an alternative to Random Forest, leveraging its sequential model building approach and potential for improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "- The ROC AUC score obtained from Trial 7 without hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search is 0.9967, indicating strong predictive accuracy of the XGBoost Classifier on the validation set.\n",
    "- The absence of Grid Search implies that default hyperparameters were used for training the XGBoost Classifier.\n",

    "**Insights:**\n",
    "- The XGBoost Classifier demonstrated strong predictive performance on the validation set, with a high ROC AUC score of 0.9967 even without hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- While hyperparameter tuning could potentially further enhance model performance, the XGBoost Classifier's default configuration already yielded impressive results.\n",

    "### Trial 8: XGBoost Classifier with Randomized Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts and Observations:**\n",
    "- **Objective:**\n",
    "  - In Trial 8, we aim to optimize the XGBoost Classifier's performance by conducting hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search.\n",
    "  - Randomized Search offers efficiency in exploring a large hyperparameter space by randomly sampling combinations, potentially uncovering better-performing configurations compared to exhaustive grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Search Space:**\n",
    "  - Define a parameter grid (`param_distributions_random_search`) for Randomized Search, covering various hyperparameters of the XGBoost Classifier and preprocessing steps.\n",
    "  - Hyperparameters include the strategy for handling missing values, number of estimators, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples required to split a node, minimum samples required at each leaf node, and whether bootstrap samples are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Randomized Search Configuration:**\n",
    "  - Utilize `RandomizedSearchCV` to perform Randomized Search on the training data (`xgboost_random_search`).\n",
    "  - Configure Randomized Search with a specified number of random trials (`n_iter=200`) to explore a diverse range of hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "  - Set the scoring metric to ROC AUC to optimize the classifier for predicting speed dating outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training and Evaluation:**\n",
    "  - Train the XGBoost Classifier using the hyperparameters discovered through Randomized Search.\n",
    "  - Evaluate the performance of the optimized XGBoost Classifier on the validation set to assess its predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan for Next Step: Trial 9 - XGBoost Classifier with Grid Search:**\n",
    "- Following Trial 8, we plan to compare the performance of the XGBoost Classifier with Randomized Search to that of the baseline model and explore whether further improvements can be achieved with Grid Search.\n",
    "- Grid Search offers an exhaustive search over a predefined grid of hyperparameters, potentially leading to more precise optimization compared to Randomized Search.\n",
    "- By comparing the results of the Randomized Search and Grid Search approaches, we aim to determine the most effective hyperparameter tuning strategy for the XGBoost Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation outlines Trial 8, focusing on hyperparameter tuning with Randomized Search for the XGBoost Classifier. The plan for Trial 9 involves comparing the performance of Randomized Search with that of Grid Search. Let me know if you need further assistance!\n"

    "  - Following the exceptional performance observed in Trial 8 with Randomized Search, Trial 9 aims to compare the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.\n",
    "  - Grid Search offers an exhaustive search over a predefined grid of hyperparameters, potentially leading to more precise optimization compared to Randomized Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Search Space:**\n",
    "  - Define a parameter grid (`param_grid_grid_search`) for Grid Search, covering various hyperparameters of the XGBoost Classifier and preprocessing steps.\n",
    "  - Hyperparameters include the strategy for handling missing values, number of estimators, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples required to split a node, minimum samples required at each leaf node, and whether bootstrap samples are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grid Search Configuration:**\n",
    "  - Utilize `GridSearchCV` to perform Grid Search on the training data (`xgboost_grid_search`).\n",
    "  - Configure Grid Search with a predefined grid of hyperparameters to explore, aiming to find the optimal combination maximizing the ROC AUC score on the validation set.\n",
    "  - Set the scoring metric to ROC AUC to optimize the classifier for predicting speed dating outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training and Evaluation:**\n",
    "  - Train the XGBoost Classifier using the hyperparameters discovered through Grid Search.\n",
    "  - Evaluate the performance of the optimized XGBoost Classifier on the validation set to assess its predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation and Comparison:**\n",
    "- Compare the performance of the XGBoost Classifier with Grid Search to that of the model optimized with Randomized Search from Trial 8.\n",
    "- Assess any differences in ROC AUC score and computational efficiency between the two hyperparameter tuning methods.\n",
    "- Analyze whether Grid Search yields superior results compared to Randomized Search in optimizing the XGBoost Classifier for predicting speed dating outcomes.\n",

    "- Trial 13 aimed to further optimize the performance of the CatBoost Classifier by conducting hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thoughts:**\n",
    "- Prior to Trial 13, the CatBoost Classifier demonstrated promising performance in Trial 12 without hyperparameter tuning. However, there was potential for further improvement through fine-tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Grid Search was chosen as the method for hyperparameter tuning due to its ability to exhaustively search through a predefined parameter grid, enabling us to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- The computational cost of Grid Search was taken into consideration, but deemed acceptable given the importance of optimizing model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **Grid Search:**\n",
    "   - Utilized GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning for the CatBoost Classifier.\n",
    "   - Defined a grid of hyperparameters including parameters related to tree depth, learning rate, number of trees, etc.\n",
    "   - Conducted an exhaustive search through the parameter grid to identify the combination of hyperparameters that maximizes the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Fitted the CatBoost Classifier pipeline with the training data (`X_train`) and corresponding target labels (`y_train`).\n",
    "   - Evaluated the performance of the tuned model on the validation set (`X_val`) using evaluation metrics such as ROC AUC score."

    "- The AdaBoost Classifier achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.8673 on the validation set without hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Previous Trials:**\n",
    "- Compared to previous trials where more complex models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were utilized, the performance of AdaBoost appears subpar.\n",
    "- AdaBoost's lower performance may be attributed to its inherent simplicity and limitations compared to more sophisticated ensemble methods.\n",
    "- AdaBoost relies on weak learners (e.g., decision trees with limited depth), which may struggle to capture complex relationships in the data compared to the more powerful models used in previous trials.\n",
    "- Additionally, AdaBoost's iterative approach of boosting may not be as effective in improving predictive performance compared to methods like gradient boosting, which adaptively adjusts weights during training.\n",
    "- The relatively low ROC AUC score obtained with AdaBoost underscores the importance of selecting appropriate models tailored to the dataset and task at hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Thoughts:**\n",
    "- The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier is a type of artificial neural network that can learn complex patterns in data.\n",
    "- MLPs are capable of handling non-linear relationships between features and target labels, making them suitable for a variety of classification tasks.\n",
    "- By utilizing MLPs, we aim to explore the potential benefits of deep learning techniques in capturing intricate patterns in the speed dating dataset.\n",
    "- However, MLPs come with certain challenges such as the need for careful hyperparameter tuning, susceptibility to overfitting, and computational complexity.\n",
    "- Prior to conducting the trial, it's important to consider the dataset's characteristics, including its size, feature space, and class distribution, to determine the suitability of MLPs for the task at hand.\n",
    "- Through this trial, we hope to gain insights into the performance of MLPs on the speed dating dataset and assess their potential as a modeling approach for binary classification tasks.\n",

    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **Pipeline Setup:**\n",
    "   - Construct a pipeline (`MLP_full_pipeline`) comprising a preprocessing step and the MLP Classifier.\n",
    "   - The preprocessing step involved handling missing values and scaling numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Training:**\n",
    "   - Fit the pipeline on the training data (`X_train`) and corresponding target labels (`y_train`).\n",
    "   - The MLP Classifier was trained on the preprocessed training data to learn the relationship between features and target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Generate predictions on the validation set (`X_val`) using the trained MLP Classifier.\n",
    "   - Calculate the ROC AUC score to assess the model's performance on the validation set."

    "\n",
    "- We construct an SVC pipeline comprising preprocessing steps and the SVC classifier.\n",

    "- The search space includes hyperparameters such as C (regularization parameter), gamma (kernel coefficient), degree (degree of the polynomial kernel), and kernel type.\n",
    "- Bayesian optimization iteratively selects hyperparameter configurations based on their expected improvement in the objective function, which in this case is the ROC AUC score.\n",
    "- We perform Bayesian optimization for a specified number of iterations, considering cross-validation with 2 folds and evaluating the performance using the ROC AUC score.\n",

    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SVC pipeline is defined with preprocessing steps and the SVC classifier.\n",
    "- Search spaces are specified for the hyperparameters, including C, gamma, degree, and kernel type.\n",
    "- Bayesian optimization is conducted using BayesSearchCV, which iteratively explores the search space to find optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "- We set the number of iterations for Bayesian optimization, random state, verbosity level, cross-validation folds, and scoring metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plan for Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After Bayesian optimization, we evaluate the performance of the SVC model with the optimized hyperparameters on the validation set.\n",
    "- We assess the ROC AUC score to determine the effectiveness of the hyperparameter tuning process.\n",
